# Discord ROBLOX Voting Bot
I created this bot so users on Discord could submit a poll vote through the Discord platform, because of it's ease of use this increased voting outcomes by lots.

## How I made it
I made this bot using Discord Bot Maker, so I suggest you buy it on steam and edit the project yourself (as you will need to change the API backend). Unless you know a good Javascript developer.

## What do I need to do to get it working?
You need to connect it to a API backend, I used bubble (as you can see in the code), you can use whatever however Bubble is really easy to use. The purpose of the backend is to handle the vote so really you can do whatever you want...log votes to a website, discord, trello whatever floats your boat.

## Credits
This bot was made by me, through the use of these programs, do what you want with it. Expand it, fix it whatever you want. *No credits are required.*
